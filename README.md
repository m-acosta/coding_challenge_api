### Introduction and Instructions
    <!-- 
    1 Pull 1000 names from some public API either in front-end code or back-end. A couple possibilities would
    be Facebook's Graph API (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference) and LinkedIn's
    API (https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/rest-api). If you are unfamiliar with OAUTH itâ€™s recommended
    you skip these options and seek an API that does not require it such as https://randomuser.me/
    2 Store the results from step 1 locally (we suggest a SQLite database, but you can use any format you'd
    like). This should be run on the back-end (i.e. imagine this is running on a server where we need the data
    on a database on the server).
    3 Develop a simple webpage that will display 100 names in a table (out of 1000).
    4 Add email and phone columns to the webpage table. Then, provide a button for each table entry that
    allows you to manually enter a phone and/or email address. Add some basic validation for the phone
    and/or email address (e.g. '123' would be rejected as a phone number). Validation can be run on either
    front-end or back-end. The data should be stored in storage you set up in step 2.
    5 Add buttons that allow you to sort the table by name or email address.
    6 Add a search function to the table.
    7 Add a button that allows you to export the table data to a .csv download file. The .csv file should reflect
    the current status of the table (including sort order and search results).
